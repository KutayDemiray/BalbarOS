## Goal
Build a lightweight OS that can host servers (hopefully easily, probably not) 

## Milestones
* Bootloader -
* I/O management -
    * Memory management -
    * Disk management -
    * Peripheral management -
* Task management -
    * Multiprocessing -
    * Multithreading -
* Networking -
* Security -


(probably these "-"s will remain there for a looooong time)

## List of sources
Here, I will gather a list of resources that may be useful during development.
